What's this?
------------

Browserhacks is an extensive list of browser specific CSS and JavaScript hacks from all over the interwebs.

Please keep in mind using a hack is not always the perfect solution. It can be useful to fix some weird browser specific bug, but in most cases you should fix your CSS/JS.


How to?
-------

1. Pick the hack you want
2. Copy it into your stylesheet
3. Add thes style you want between the braces
4. Enjoy the new styles for the browser you targeted!

3. We push to `master`
