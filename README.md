What's this?
------------

Browserhacks is an extensive list of browser specific CSS and JavaScript hacks from all over the interwebs. Special thanks to [Paul Irish' comprehensive post](http://paulirish.com/2009/browser-specific-css-hacks/) and [Nicolas Gallagher's additions](https://gist.github.com/necolas/983116).

How to?
-------

 1. Checkout this branch
 2. `npm install`
 3. run `grunt dev`
 4. Browserhacks should run on `http://localhost:8000`. You can edit scss or the handelbars template in ./assemble/templates/(layout|pages)


Reminder!
---------

Please keep in mind using a hack is not always the perfect solution. It can be useful to fix some weird browser specific bug, but in most cases you should fix your CSS/JS.


Here is a little pen to fork and edit when we want to ask for people's help to test a hack: http://codepen.io/HugoGiraudel/pen/HEoJx.
