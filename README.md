@Hugo: I removed all styles and stuff so that you can create your own theme based on this. You should edit **browserhacks.scss** and look at [crystallo documentation](http://timpietrusky.github.com/crystallo/) if you want to know how to use crystallo (CSS responsive framework). I will add more code on thursday (php and backbone so that you can play with real data). 

@Mads: If you want to contribute, just say what you want to do :D
